## Introduction

How fast does the view count of a YouTube video grow? For a content creator, knowing the answer to such a question, especially for the first few hours a video goes live, can be extremely important in gauging audience reach and channel performance. Having a good sense of how well one’s channel is doing allows a creator to know how to plan and manage their YouTube channels. In this project, we aimed to predict the percentage change in views on a video between the second and sixth hour after it’s uploaded using predictors that fall into the following four categories: thumbnail image features, video title features, channel features, other features.

Our most successful prediction model was a random forest model (specifically bagging).
